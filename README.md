# Chris Curmi Front End Test

## Assumptions

1. To run project, run npm-install in terminal and access localhost:3000/

Working exercise is visible when clicking the Vendors link.
On top part of Vendors Page one can find first Task named as 'Vendors Game Counts', which displays a list of Vendors and Count of each entity in the dataset

Scrolling down, one will find the second task named 'Games'
Text box filter is available to filter through the dataset and re-render the component to display filtered values.
Check box is availble below, to filter only the live values from dataset.
On scroll down, one can find the Load more button, which when clicked, will load 30 more values from the dataset.

### Lazy Loading

An image is appended per row in the 'Games' section, to more visualize lazy loading of rows and images in the application.
On scroll down, one can notice new rows being rendered on scroll to better manage resources of the application

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node](https://nodejs.org)**
2. **Navigate to this project's root directory on the command line.**
3. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
4. **Once finished, type `npm run` and access application in http://localhost:3000**

## How to run:

1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll get an error when you try to start the app later.
2. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It will cause issues with file watches.
3. Delete any .eslintrc in your user directory and disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules within your editor since these will conflict with the ESLint rules defined.
4. On Windows? Open your console as an administrator. This will assure the console has the necessary rights to perform installs.
5. Nothing above work? Delete your node_modules folder and re-run npm install.
